## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , my name is Tilova and I am a Data Scientist. 

### About me
- ðŸŽ“ I am a Computer Science graduate with experience as a Software Engineer.
- ðŸ’» Implemented agile best practices, designed and developed a full-stack features in React/TypeScript, automated database migration in SQL, optimized query performance and escalations in GCP and Kibana for a client base of 4000+.
- ðŸ“š Embarking on a journey into data science at BrainStation, delving into data visualization, machine learning, and big data, while mastering tools like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow and more.
- ðŸŒ± I want to utilize the skills I have now and what i'm learning at BrainStation to later become a machine learning engineer. I want to transform incomprehensible datasets into insights, stories and unknown discoveries. With my coding background, I've been able to scrape data and transform them into something feasible for data insights. I currently am working on a machine learning model to predict Toronto's potential parking offences based on its location.

### Current Project: Toronto Parking Ticket Data (2016-2022) ðŸš€
- Data Cleaning and EDA on yearly revenue, top parking offences, major hotspots based on season, holiday, sports match etc. Applying proper datetime from '20160101' to '2016-01-01' and '123' to '01:23'. 
- Feature Engineering: Classifying parking offences into groups. Using Geopy to convert addresses into latitude and longitude.
- Modeling: Classifying parking offences using KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
